Browser understands only JS due to js engine. But browsers do not understand react code. So, first of all react needs to be configured into our project.
1. CDN react -> There are cdn links which host the react libraries. We add this cdn link to our code to pull that react into our project. 
This is not preferred since we have to keep hitting the url. Also, in case of upgrade of react versions we have to keep updating the links.
	CDN of react gives us 2 source files:
	A - Core react
	B - React dom -> This is the react library useful for DOM openrations.
2. Installing react in packages

// Move everything written within second scripts of index.html here and in the script add src pointing here

// element is a core thing of react. Hence it comes from the first library which is the core library.
// dom is comes from the second library which is the react-dom library.

// created nested html structure

React.createElement arguments:
// The first is the tag. Second is props. Third is children
// After the above statement, you need to tell react where to render this heading
// so we first create a root inside react where react can do all the DOM stuff
It returns a react element and not an html element. a react element is a js object which browser understands. 
This JS object then gets rendered as an HTML element
You can console.log(heading1) to see.

Root.render()
// the render method takes a js object as an input and converts into a tag which can be put in the DOM
// The render method always replaces anything that is already present in the element where you are renedering. 
That's why at a time for ele1.render(xxx) and ele1.render(yyy), the second one will be visible on browser.

Target:

/**
 * <div id="parent">
 *      <div id="child">
 *          <h1></h1>
 *          <h2></h2>
 *      </div>
 *      <div id="child">
 *          <h1></h1>
 *          <h2></h2>
 *      </div>
 * </div>
 */
